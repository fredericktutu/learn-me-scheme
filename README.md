# learn-me-scheme
## hello guys! These days I am reviewing my Skills for Scheme by implementing the functions which are mentioned in "The Little Schemer". I do this to prepare myself for my comming project, which is a Lisp Interpreter with Stack VM.

---
+ The codes are organized by the order of each chapter, and later I'm going to add my understanding of these functions in this readme file.

+ The attached scheme file is a ready-made Scheme Interpreter, which is from the UC Berkeley CS61A course 2019 summer that I attended. you can run the .scm files by `python scheme -i xxx.scm`

Thanks for reading!
